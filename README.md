*unbalance

this is a reworking of the Imbalance 2 theme by WP Shower. I wanted to make this theme responsive and provide a little more control over some of the elements. This theme has become a kind of weathervane for breaking down the wall that prevented designers or more visually inclined people from blogging. By using a strong visual layout, employing the featured image, combined with the somewhat mysterious way of ordering or laying out the content, designers are able to get away from the linear reverse-chronological layout of a blog. But it is a trick that actually enables the rapid publishing of content, driven by categorization that allows the content to come first and the overall design to fall into the background and be far more subtle. As walls should be.

I aim with this theme to unbalance the world of design and production. A small goal, I know.
